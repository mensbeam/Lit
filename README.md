# Lit #

Lit is a multilanguage syntax highlighter written in PHP. It takes code as input and returns HTML with classes based upon tokens in the code. It is loosely based upon [Atom][a]'s [Highlights][b] which is used in the Atom text editor to syntax highlight code. Atom's Highlights is in turn based upon [TextMate][c]'s syntax highlighting using its concepts of scope selectors and common classes for components of programming languages.
